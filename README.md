# sf-shows

Script for finding out which musicians I like are playing in the SF area soon.

Currently scraping:
- [foopee's The List](http://www.foopee.com/punk/the-list/)
- [Bay Improviser](https://www.bayimproviser.com/calendar.aspx)
- [SFCM](https://sfcm.edu/performance-calendar)

TODOs:
- for The List, fetch venue, date and price for any hits
- compare against list of favorite artists in discogs lists
- scrape for extended date ranges
- write script to turn mp3 directory into favorite artist list automatically
- add UI?
